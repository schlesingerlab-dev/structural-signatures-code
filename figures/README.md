# Figures directory 

Contains the code used to generate figures for structural signatures. 

`1-figure/` generates figures 1A-D + supplemental figure 1-2 + supplemental table 1 

**All of the code references a `data/` directory** This is a directory that houses data used to generate figures. Due to the size of the generated data, it is not included in this repo, but is available upon request.
